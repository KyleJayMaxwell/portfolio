      <h4 class="aboutme">Eager to get learning at galvanize, after the JS work shop I took at the Platte campus. I started learning front-end design at the art institute along with graphic design too. I come from a more designer background, but realized I enjoyed the web part of it and decided to take learning into my own hands. I had a mentor that first introduced me to github and frameworks. Right now i use grunt and browser sync along with scss. I just didn't know where to take the next step in learning this. So galvanize was a perfect fit. In all reality my goal is to make an app that I want while here, and then set up a job overseas after I finish the program. I hope to be part of the community and participate in all the things galvanize has to offer.</h4>
